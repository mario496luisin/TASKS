this code is not a code, you dont declare any variables, it could be a javascript file as you can see the for loop or print
but you dont specify any variables so if you write this you will see a warning or error in the console in the browser. 
So the output would be an error. It doesnt acomplish the coding protocol so the browser will read it as plain text.
