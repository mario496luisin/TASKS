To call the json file we need to set a variable as new that we called it ourRequest.
To pass the json data I have told the browser that the var ourData is Json. I have added an event listeaner to click the button and show the data by calling the button in the html file getPosts and then it is going to take the id called posts. the value click will trigger the data. For testing purposes I have made a code which is console.log(ourData[0]); to see the first id in the console in the browser and its commented out in the file task3.js. After this we want to add html elements to display the data so I created a function called renderHTML and I passed ourData variable which is ourData so its going to add html to the empty div element in the html file which is  posts. To display the data in the div when we click the button we need to create a variable that I have called getPosts and it will be trigerred by passing the id. After that the function renderHTML will display the data how we want to style it. So this consists on passing the values and variables depending on where we need them. To be seen properly i have used for loop and with logic you can see the "i" which is initial value has to be equal 0 to start as usual in Javascript and it can't be less than 0 like data.length we specify that and with i++ we add one every time.Finally we construct the html as you see by taking the data which is the base and then the following data like title, body, userId or id.
