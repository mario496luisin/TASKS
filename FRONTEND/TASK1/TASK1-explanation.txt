FRONT END TASK1

I HAVE ADDED THE IMG TAG INSIDE THE ANCHOR INSTEAD OF THE WORD BOZBOZ IN THE ANCHOR TAG.

I HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE IMAGE BY USING THE SCALE VALUE AND ALSO TO HOVER I HAVE USED THE VALUE ROTATE WITH THE TRANSITION TO SEE THE EFFECT PROPERLY. WHEN YOU HOVER OUT THE LOGO IS RETURNING TO THE INITIAL STATE BY ADDING TO THE IMAGE A TRANSITION OF 1 SECOND. I HAVE PUT ENOUGH SIZE NUMBER FOR YOU TO SEE THAT THE SIZE IS ACTUALLY CHANGING.

TO FINISH I HAVE PUT MARGIN TO CENTER IT.
